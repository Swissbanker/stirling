    <h1>Connection Status</h1>
    <p>
    The Heartbeat message is used to monitor the status of the connection.
    When either end of the connection has not received any data for
    (HeartBtInt + "some reasonable transmission time") seconds, a TestRequest
    message is transmitted. It forces a Heartbeat message to be transmitted
    from the opposing side.
    </p>

    <div class="example">
        <h3>Example</h3>
        <p>
        When TestRequest message with TestReqID set to
        <span concordion:set="#testReqId">test-id</span> is
        received, <span concordion:execute="receiveTestRequest(#testReqId)" />
        we reply with a <span concordion:assertEquals="getResponse()">Heartbeat</span>
        message that has TestReqID set to
        <span concordion:assertEquals="getTestReqId()">test-id</span> as well.
