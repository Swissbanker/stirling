Known Bugs
==========

- Messages are not processed in-order. For example, if sequence reset follows
  an invalid execution report, we reject the execution report instead of
  processing the sequence reset first.

- Outgoing messages are not queued. See session level test Ref ID 16.

- Message rejection doesn't work if MsgSeqNum is missing from standard header.

- Logic should be included in the FIX engine to recognize the possible infinite
  resend loop, which may be encountered in this situation.

- PerformanceTest doesn't use external data store which skews results.

- PossResend messages are ignored.

- Conditionally required repeating groups are not supported.

- Encryption is not handled at all. See session level test Ref ID 17.
