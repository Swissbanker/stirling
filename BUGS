Known Bugs
==========

- Messages are not processed in-order. For example, if sequence reset follows
  an invalid execution report, we reject the execution report instead of
  processing the sequence reset first.

- Message rejection doesn't work if MsgSeqNum is missing from standard header.

- Conditionally required repeating groups are not supported.
