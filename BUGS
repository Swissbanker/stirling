Known Bugs
==========

- Outgoing messages are not queued. See session level tst Ref ID 16.

- Encryption is not handled at all. See session level test Ref ID 17.

- Messages with PossResend = "Y" are not handled appropriately. See session
  level tests Ref ID 19 and 20.

- Messages are not processed in-order. For example, if sequence reset follows
  an invalid execution report, we reject the execution report instead of
  processing the sequence reset first.

- Message rejection doesn't work if MsgSeqNum is missing from standard header.

- Conditionally required repeating groups are not supported.
