== xTCH encoder/decoder

xTCH is a library for encoding and decoding protocols similar to the NASDAQ
Stock Market's INET low-latency market data (ITCH) and order entry (OUCH)
protocols [1]. xTCH also introduces session management for the supported
protocol profiles.

== Protocol Profiles

Currently, xTCH supports only a subset of Soup TCP 2.0.
